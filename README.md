# BiocOpenCRAVAT

Annotation of DNA variants is a crucial and dynamic field in
human disease genetics.  The [OpenCRAVAT system](https://github.com/KarchinLab/open-cravat/wiki)
organizes over 170 'annotators' that resolve queries on features of
genetic variants.

The BiocOpenCRAVAT workspace/workshop materials define interfaces between
Bioconductor data structures and functions and the OpenCRAVAT system, to
simplify the use of OpenCRAVAT annotation by Bioconductor users, and
to simplify aspects of adding new annotation resources to OpenCRAVAT.
